## Jackpot Degen Overview

#### Application Architecture

Jackpot Degen is a full stack application and starts with the database in the backend built with [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/model-querying-basics.html), [Express](https://expressjs.com/), using a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database.

## Backend Overview
All data is fetched from the [Express](https://expressjs.com/) server, including queries to the database. The news comes from an RSS feed in  XML format from [pokernews.com](https://www.pokernews.com/) and then stored throughout multiple layers of the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) store along with subscriptions, jackpots auth and other user information.  This gives users quicker load times since data is only retireved as necessary or when something in the user's dashboard changes.
Only data needed is retrieved, for example, jackpot data histories are only fetched if it is not already in the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) store and the user is on a page requiring it, saving memory and increasing efficiency.

## Frontend Overview

As stated before [React](https://reactjs.org/) is used and is at the core of application logic and frontend architecture.  Many built-in React 
[Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) are used to aid in passing data around throughout components as well as [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and Redux [Hooks](https://react-redux.js.org/api/hooks) and [Redux Thunk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-thunk) and regular props. All of the design and animation is done with vanilla [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS), [Chartjs](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/) and, makes use of conditionals in [React](https://reactjs.org/) based on what the user is currently interacting with.

## Security & Authorization

[Express](https://expressjs.com/), [express-validator](https://express-validator.github.io/docs/) and,[bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) are utilized for setting users login sessions in the backend and to handle hashed passwords. 

## Conclusion & Future Features

Jackpot Degen was my first solo full-stack project and incredibly helpful in my ongoing quest to master react and express. I have been playing poker my entire life and come from a family of poker players.  Finding the poker room with the highest current jackpot has always been a struggle and currently the only way to accomplish this, is to call each room one by one.  If you are in a unfamiliar city this is a near impossible feat. This is the reason I felt inspired to built Jackpot Degen and I hope to continue to improve this project and one day release it for scalable usage to poker players everywhere.  

 For features that I plan for the future please keep reading and check out my stretch goals.
